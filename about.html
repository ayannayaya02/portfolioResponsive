    <h1 class="about">About Me</h1>
    <p>Just to discuss a little more about myself I am an aspiring Software Engineer. I enjoy playing guitar and training for Martial Arts. The speicific Martial Arts that I do are Jiu-Jitsu and Muay Thai. I also really enjoy coding because I like to build whatever I'd like. As well as, I have always loved a challenege. For as long as I can remember if there was anything that I was interetsed in I would try to teach myself. I have self-motivated and self-discipline drive and mindset. If I have a goal in mind, and put in my best efforts then I truly believe I can accomplish whatever I put my mind to. </p>
